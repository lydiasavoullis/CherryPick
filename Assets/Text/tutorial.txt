Left click on a flower and right click on a different flower to breed two flowers. The resulting flower produced will have a mix of the two parent flowers' genetics. Hover over a flower to examine their genes. For colour: RR = Red, Rr = Pink, rr = white. For height: TT or Tt = tall and tt = short. Press 'Gather Plants' to transfer all correct plants to the collection point. If you find the list cluttered at any point, hover over a plant and press the 'delete' key to remove an unwanted plant. In game you will have 30 seconds to breed and gather a certain number of plants for an order. You will always start with one plant that has two different variants of the same gene(heterozygous). This should make all combinations feasible. Although some may be more difficult to complete than others. Press Enter to start tutorial, select space to toggle hide/show tutorial box.
